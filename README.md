# NumericalMethods
Numerical methods implemented in C++

RealMatrix - program in which we can create square, real matrix and count it's determiant, eigenvalues, LU and QR decomposition, inverse matrix

ComplexMatrix - the same operations as above but for complex matrix

InterpoacjaWielomianowa - an interpolation polynomial for a given set of data points, coefficients of the polynomial are calculated using Newton's divided differences method
